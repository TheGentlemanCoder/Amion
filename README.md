### AVISTAD

A portmanteau of the Spanish words for "airplane" and "friendship".
I built this WAP because I wanted to see my friends after our graduation.
We were broke and needed a way to decide on where to have our reunions.

### What does this WAP do?

From a list of provided locations, Avistad calculates which location would
be collectively cheapest for a group of people to fly to with round-trip
tickets.

### What do I need to use this WAP?

- List of meeting locations, any of which you and your friends would be okay meeting at
- List of starting locations, wherever you and your friends will fly from
- Starting date, the day you all wish to arrive to the meeting location
- Ending date, the day you all wish to arrive home

### Why is my ticket more expensive?!?!

Avistad calculates which location offers the cheapester *average* ticket. Naturally,
that means that some will pay more than the average for their ticket and some will
pay less. If the cost of travel is truly an issue, I hope that your friends would
help you. No software can bring about kindness.
