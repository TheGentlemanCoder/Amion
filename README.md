## AVISTAD

A portmanteau of the Spanish word for "plane" and "friendship". This WAP was born out
of a desire to see my friends after we graduated college. But getting a large group of
people to all agree on a single location is difficult, especially when everyone is broke.

## What does this WAP do? 

Use Avistad to find the collectively cheapest location for a group of people at different
starting locations to fly to.

## What do I need to use this WAP?

- List of meeting locations, any of which you and your friends would be okay visiting.
- List of starting locations, wherever you and each of your friends will be starting from and going back to at the end of the trip.
- Start date, the day when everyone should arrive to the meeting location
- End date, the day when everyone should head back home

## What exactly is being minimized?

The average cost of each plane ticket. Naturally, some individuals may have to pay
more for their ticket than others. Knowing that a selected location is the minimum
*average* plane ticket cost, you and your friends could pool your money together and
divide your costs evenly. If you are flying somewhere far to meet them, I hope they
would pitch in to help cover your costs anyways.
